### About the Standard

The Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS) is a community‑driven catalogue of security requirements that data scientists, MLOps engineers, software architects, developers, testers, security professionals, tool vendors, regulators, and consumers can use to design, build, test, and verify trustworthy AI‑enabled systems and applications. It provides a common language for specifying security controls across the AI lifecycle—from data collection and model development to deployment and ongoing monitoring—so that organizations can measure and improve the resilience, privacy, and safety of their AI solutions.

AISVS is a brand‑new standard created specifically to address the unique security challenges of artificial‑intelligence systems. While it draws inspiration from broader security best practices, every requirement in AISVS has been developed from the ground up to reflect the AI threat landscape and to help organizations build safer, more resilient AI solutions.

## Preface

Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS) version 1.0!

### Introduction

Established in 2025 through a collaborative community effort, AISVS defines the security requirements to consider when designing, developing, deploying, and operating modern AI models, pipelines, and AI‑enabled services.

AISVS v1.0 represents the combined work of its project leads, working group, and wider community contributors to produce a pragmatic, testable baseline for securing AI systems.

Our goal with this release is to make AISVS straightforward to adopt while staying laser‑focused on its defined scope and addressing the rapidly evolving risk landscape unique to AI.

### Key Objectives for AISVS Version 1.0

Version 1.0 will be created with several guiding principles.

#### Well‑Defined Scope

Each requirement must align with AISVS’s name and mission:

Artificial Intelligence – Controls operate at the AI/ML layer (data, model, pipeline, or inference) and are the responsibility of AI practitioners.
Security – Requirements directly mitigate identified security, privacy, or safety risks.
Verification – Language is written so conformance can be objectively validated.
Standard – Sections follow a consistent structure and terminology to form a coherent reference.
​

By following AISVS, organizations can systematically evaluate and strengthen the security posture of their AI solutions, fostering a culture of secure AI engineering.

## Using the AISVS

The Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Standard (AISVS) defines security requirements for modern AI applications and services, focusing on aspects within the control of application developers.

The AISVS is intended for anyone developing or evaluating the security of AI applications, including developers, architects, security engineers, and auditors. This chapter introduces the structure and use of the AISVS, including its verification levels and intended use cases.

### Artificial Intelligence Security Verification Levels

The AISVS defines three ascending levels of security verification. Each level adds depth and complexity, enabling organizations to tailor their security posture to the risk level of their AI systems.

Organizations may begin at Level 1 and progressively adopt higher levels as security maturity and threat exposure increase.

#### Definition of the Levels

Each requirement in AISVS v1.0 is assigned to one of the following levels:

 Level 1 requirements

Level 1 includes the most critical and foundational security requirements. These focus on preventing common attacks that do not rely on other preconditions or vulnerabilities. Most Level 1 controls are either straightforward to implement or essential enough to justify the effort.

 Level 2 requirements

Level 2 addresses more advanced or less common attacks, as well as layered defenses against widespread threats. These requirements may involve more complex logic or target specific attack prerequisites.

 Level 3 requirements

Level 3 includes controls that are typically harder to implement or situational in applicability. These often represent defense-in-depth mechanisms or mitigations against niche, targeted, or high-complexity attacks.

#### Role (D/V)

Each AISVS requirement is marked according to the primary audience:

D – Developer-focused requirements
V – Verifier/auditor-focused requirements
D/V – Relevant to both developers and verifiers

## C1 Training Data Governance & Bias Management

### Control Objective

## C2 User Input Validation

### Control Objective

Robust validation of user input is a first-line defense against some of the most damaging attacks on AI systems. Prompt injection attacks can override system instructions, leak sensitive data, or steer the model toward behavior that is not allowed. Unless dedicated filters and instruction hierarchies are in place, research shows that "multi-shot" jailbreaks that exploit very long context windows will be effective. Also, subtle adversarial perturbation attacks--such as homoglyph swaps or leetspeak—-can silently change a model's decisions.

---

### C2.1 Prompt Injection Defense

Prompt injection is one of the top risks for AI systems. Defenses against this tactic employ a combination of static pattern filters, dynamic classifiers and instruction hierarchy enforcement.

 #2.1.1    Level: 1    Role: D/V
 Verify that user inputs are screened against a continuously updated library of known prompt injection patterns (jailbreak keywords, "ignore previous", role-play chains, indirect HTML/URL attacks).
 #2.1.2    Level: 1    Role: D/V
 Verify that the system enforces an instruction hierarchy in which system or developer messages override user instructions, even after context window expansion.
 #2.1.3    Level: 2    Role: D/V
 Verify that adversarial evaluation tests (e.g., Red Team "many-shot" prompts) are run before every model or prompt-template release, with success-rate thresholds and automated blockers for regressions.
 #2.1.4    Level: 2    Role: D
 Verify that prompts originating from third-party content (web pages, PDFs, emails) are sanitized in an isolated parsing context before being concatenated into the main prompt.
 #2.1.5    Level: 3    Role: D/V
 Verify that all prompt-filter rule updates, classifier model versions and block-list changes are version-controlled and auditable.

---

### C2.2 Adversarial-Example Resistance

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are still vulnerable to subtle character or word-level perturbations that humans often miss but models tend to misclassify.

 #2.2.1    Level: 1    Role: D
 Verify that basic input normalization steps (Unicode NFC, homoglyph mapping, whitespace trimming) run before tokenization.
 #2.2.2    Level: 2    Role: D/V
 Verify that statistical anomaly detection flags inputs with unusually high edit distance to language norms, excessive repeated tokens, or abnormal embedding distances.
 #2.2.3    Level: 2    Role: D
 Verify that the inference pipeline supports optional adversarial-training–hardened model variants or defense layers (e.g., randomization, defensive distillation) for high-risk endpoints.
 #2.2.4    Level: 2    Role: V
 Verify that suspected adversarial inputs are quarantined, logged with full payloads (after PII redaction).
 #2.2.5    Level: 3    Role: D/V
 Verify that robustness metrics (success rate of known attack suites) are tracked over time and regressions trigger a release blocker.

---

### C2.3 Schema, Type & Length Validation

AI attacks featuring malformed or oversized inputs can cause parsing errors, prompt spillage across fields, and resource exhaustion.  Strict schema enforcement is also a prerequisite when performing deterministic tool calls.

 #2.3.1    Level: 1    Role: D
 Verify that every API or function call endpoint defines an explicit input schema (JSON Schema, Protobuf or multimodal equivalent) and that inputs are validated before prompt assembly.
 #2.3.2    Level: 1    Role: D/V
 Verify that inputs exceeding maximum token or byte limits are rejected with a safe error and never silently truncated.
 #2.3.3    Level: 2    Role: D/V
 Verify that type checks (e.g., numeric ranges, enum values, MIME types for images/audio) are enforced server-side, not only in client code.
 #2.3.4    Level: 2    Role: D
 Verify that semantic validators (e.g., JSON Schema) run in constant time to prevent algorithmic DoS.
 #2.3.5    Level: 3    Role: V
 Verify that validation failures are logged with redacted payload snippets and unambiguous error codes to aid security triage.

---

### C2.4 Content & Policy Screening

Developers should be able to detect syntactically valid prompts that request disallowed content (such as illicit instructions, hate speech, and copyrighted text) then prevent them from propagating.

 #2.4.1    Level: 1    Role: D

 Verify that the screening model or rule set is retrained/updated at least quarterly, incorporating newly observed jailbreak or policy bypass patterns.
 #2.4.4    Level: 2    Role: D
 Verify that screening respects user-specific policies (age, regional legal constraints) via attribute-based rules resolved at request time.
 #2.4.5    Level: 3    Role: V
 Verify that screening logs include classifier confidence scores and policy category tags for SOC correlation and future red-team replay.

 Verify that anomalous usage patterns (e.g., rapid-fire requests, input flooding) trigger automated blocks or escalations.
 #2.5.4    Level: 3    Role: V
 Verify that abuse prevention logs are retained and reviewed for emerging attack patterns.

---

## C8 Memory, Embeddings & Vector Database Security

### Control Objective

Embeddings and vector stores act as the "live memory" of contemporary AI systems, continuously accepting user-supplied data and surfacing it back into model contexts via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). If left ungoverned, this memory can leak PII, violate consent, or be inverted to reconstruct the original text. The objective of this control family is to harden memory pipelines and vector databases so that access is least-privilege, embeddings are privacy-preserving, stored vectors expire or can be revoked on demand, and per-user memory never contaminates another user's prompts or completions.
